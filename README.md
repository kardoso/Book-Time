## The project
This project was created for the completion of the [React Fundamentals Course](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/React-Fundamentals-%E2%80%93-Build-beautifully-fast-websites/531548558/projects)

The project was to create an Online Bookshelf, I called it `Book Time`. 

The features requested are

- Showing the list of all books
- A form to add new books
- Books should have a title, an author, a read/want-to-read/not-interested state and an optional rating
- Remember the books after closing the page (using localStorage)
